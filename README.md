# Network Simulation
A small network simulated using cisco packet tracer, with subnets built using VLSM. Implementation of different concepts such as RIP, EIGRP, OSPF and NAT.

- Public and private IP address for this network is given in ipaddr.txt. Also included are the number of hosts required for each subnet (A-N)
- Network topology is added here as well
- Subnets.xlsx contains details about each subnet (size, addresses, mask, address range, broadcast address..)
